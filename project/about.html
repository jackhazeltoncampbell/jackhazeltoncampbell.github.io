            <h2>About the Database</h2>
            <p>
            For as long as I've played D&D, I've always loved to play classes that focus on healing and divine powers. In other games, it's pretty simple - you just <i>use</i> holy powers, and that's that. In D&D, there's a huge focus on who your deity is, what they mean to you, how you pray to them and use their power - there's a lot to consider for both gameplay and role-play reasons!
            </p>
            <p>
            Because of this, I'd have to research the various Faerûn D&D deities to figure out what they're all about. Of course there's always the Player's Handbook with a quick reference for some of the deities, but I wanted a full, comprehensive list of all the deities. Their symbols, alignments, domains, and some info on what they're followers may be like. I also ended up including links to each and ever deity's link on the Forgotten Realms wiki, for if you want more detailed, comprehensive information on the specific deity.
            </p>
            <p>And thus, the D&D Deity Database was born! Hopefully you enjoy this simplistic, easy-to-use website and add more complex lore to your campaigns, or simply make more interesting and complex characters!</p>
